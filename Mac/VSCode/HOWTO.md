## Visual Studio Code won't update

VSCode has by default (when downloaded) only read access - it's in the Downloads folder -> it won't update itself and won't let you update it To fix this, do the following...

+ Move Visual Studio Code to the Applications folder

+ Open VSCode and click the settings icon 

+ Scroll all the way down in the menu and click Check for Updates...

After this, VSCode will check for updates and if it finds any, gets updated!
